Identified Vulnerabilities
1. Reentrancy Vulnerability:

The withdraw function first transfers Ether and then updates the user's balance. This order allows a malicious contract to call withdraw recursively before the user's balance is updated, potentially draining funds.
2. Improper Access Control:

There are no access restrictions on the withdraw function. Any address can call it, which is generally acceptable in this context but could be risky if the contract evolves.
3. Integer Overflows/Underflows:

Solidity 0.8.0 and later has built-in overflow and underflow protection, so the code is safe from this vulnerability in its current form.



Proposed Solutions
1. Reentrancy Guard:

Implement a reentrancy guard to ensure that a function cannot be invoked while it is already executing.
2. Access Control:

Implement an onlyOwner modifier or similar mechanisms to control access to critical functions, particularly if the contractâ€™s functionality expands.
3. Safe Math Operations:

Since Solidity 0.8.0 has built-in checks for arithmetic operations, the current implementation does not require changes for safe math.
